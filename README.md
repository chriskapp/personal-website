Hello, my name is Christoph, I am a software developer and I like to build and innovate solutions for the API ecosystem using type-safe/oop languages like PHP, TypeScript and Java.

I have started several open source projects like [Fusio](https://www.fusio-project.org/), a popular open source API management system or [PSX](https://phpsx.org/) a framework and set of components dedicated to build modern API solutions. I am also the author of the TypeAPI and TypeSchema specification which provides a new way to describe REST APIs in a type-safe way.

Please take a look at my website [chrisk.app](https://chrisk.app/) to get an overview about all my projects. I am working as team lead software developer at Artemeon where we build RegTech solutions for the financial and insurance sector.
