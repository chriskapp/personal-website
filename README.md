Hello, my name is Christoph. I am a software developer, and I enjoy building and innovating solutions for the API
ecosystem using type-safe and object-oriented languages such as PHP, TypeScript, and Java. Please take a look at my
website [chrisk.app](https://chrisk.app/) to get an overview of all my projects.
